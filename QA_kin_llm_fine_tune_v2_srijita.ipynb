If Boo has any additional symptoms as asked in the questions above and you are truly concerned her abdomen is swollen or distended, I would take her to an emergency veterinarian for evaluation to make sure it is not something more serious going on. More information from you with help provide me more insight and advice.  I look forward to hearing back from you.
